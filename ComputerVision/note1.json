Computer Vison note.
images are matrice of number.
Agenda( total of 27 ,meeting)
1- Vision Basics
 digital image, formation and processing
most homework in matlab

lecture 3 and 4( images enhancement), image processing
edge dectection.

2- 3 D images
mostly geometry of object.
camera model

camera calibration.
being able to recover camera parameter by reverse eng the image and tell the specs of the camera.

3d computer vison( will include motion vision)
//----------------------------------------------------------
for course project, we may want to use OpenCV, C++, Java Python
HW=40%
exam 20%
---------------------
Difference between Image processing and computer vision
compVision( given image sequence, you recover 3d model and iD object)( not just simple Transformation, motion, produce more images)
CompGraphic( input is image and output is image)

AI( Pattern Recognition)- now moslty machine learning
not just images, Field that req data analytics

Application use in computer vision( photogrametry, medical imaging(CT, MRI, 3D), video(encoding, decoding, compression and transmission)

Computer vison application( Visual Inspection, robotics, iintelligent image)

job market( Homeland Security, surveillance)
Media production(cartoon, moovie, tv, photography)
 Virtual Reality( 2d and 3D virtual walk through
Comsumer medical ressouce

Lesson1- What is computer vision
Vision is the art of seeing things invisible.

determing from an image sequence the object present in the scene, relationship between the observe and the scene, the structure and model.
-direct Measurable in an image
Spectral characteristic(intensity, color, and ther spatial distribution)
2d shapes of contours
Linear Perspective
