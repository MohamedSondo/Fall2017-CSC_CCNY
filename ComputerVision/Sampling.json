  Effect of Sampling interval:
  sampling interval is equal to size of structure.

Spatial sampling; Rate cannot be larger than Half of it.
Interpolation of up and downsampling.
  sampling theor. if size of smallest structure to be preserv is d, then
  the sampling interval must not be larger than d/2.

  -Quantization is opposite to sampling.
  2^k
  Color Gray Level.
Tesselation Pattern.

hexagonal, Rectangular, Typical, Triangular.

Pixel: Picture element or Pixel.
Each point in a digital image.
Eaxch Pixel has l(i,j)
Binary(0,1)

Binary image with multiple Object.
Separate object must be label individually.
Label neighhoor base on the same Value. Use recursion for labeling.
Algorithm.
-scan, if label then Skip, then do recursion until end.

Alternate neighhoor Definition:
4 niegh(object), 8 neigh(bacground)
