Image formation:
image is a function f(x,y) that repr Intensity, Range image, color. video

how image is generated:radiometry is the amount of light get fomr reflection of sunlight and register by senseor.
Ligth reflection and matter: can be reflection, refraction,diffraction. absorption, scterring

image Geometry:pinhole camera model
perspective : Image pass througth center point and image is oppose on the surface.

Depth is obtain by triangulation.
image: 2D array of brightness
Geometry: where the image will be projected.
radiometry:
    -brightness
    -images brightness: irradiance
    -

    irradiance: ls(pi/4)[d/f]^2cos^4alpha;
